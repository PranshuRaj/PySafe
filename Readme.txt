Hello Everyone
please read the points carefully

step1) open this program in script mode to edit the data
     a) change maine_email, password to your smtp account credentials

step2) assuming you have my sql account first you have to create a database
sql commands :-
1) create database database_name;
2) use database_name;
3) create table table_name(S_no int, Name varchar(65), password varchar(65),email_id varchar(65) , phone_number varchar(65));

now, 
edit the script by changing sql_password, sql_database with your password of sql and database name of your sql which you want to use


That's all
Thank You
